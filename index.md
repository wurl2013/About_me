### About me
I am a graduate student from University of California, Davis. I double-majored in Statistics and Horticulture & Agronomy. My research interest is about grassland ecology, biomass prediction and optimized grazing management. My advisor is Dr. Emilio Laca. In UC Davis, I also worked as TA and GSR. Before this I was an undergraduate student in Zhejiang Univerysity, China, where I studied environmental chemistry and plant physiology.

I plant to graduate in June. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in Data Sciences. Feel free to contact me at rlwu@ucdavis.edu
